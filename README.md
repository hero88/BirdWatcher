# BirdWatcher

This is a native Android application where users can share their observations to
other users. These observations include name of the species, rarity, notes and timestamp. User
could include geolocation to the observation. Because observations are usually done in
areas where network connection is limited user should be able to record observations while offline.

IN THIS PROJECT:
1. Users can view previous observations (name, rarity, notes, date time, and location).
2. Users can add a new observation with current time and location.
3. Observations will be saved locally on device.

HOW TO RUN:
1. Download the project codes
2. Open project with Android Studio.
3. Setup your emulator device.
4. Build and run.
